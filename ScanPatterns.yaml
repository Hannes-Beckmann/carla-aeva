# List of available scan patterns.
patterns:
  # This scan pattern has a uniform distribution of 64 total lines and 19.2 degrees of vertical FoV.
  64-19.2-Uniform:
    # The angular resolution is determined by the horizontal FoV and points per line.
    # In this case 144 / 3051 = 0.0472 degrees.

    # List of elevation angles swept by each beam.
    # The total number of lines in a frame is equal to len(elevation_steps_deg) * num_beams,
    # since for each elevation step there are num_beams non-overlapping beams scanned simulateneously.
